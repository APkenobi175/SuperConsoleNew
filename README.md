# Super Console New

* I am working on a new version of my origianl super console launcher project.

* This new version will be written in python using the kivy framework for the GUI, and will use poetry for dependency management and packaging.

* I have learned a lot since I wrote the original super console launcher, and I want to apply that knowledge to make a better version.
* This new version will also be more modular and easier to maintain than the original version.

* Stay tuned for updates as I work on this new project!
